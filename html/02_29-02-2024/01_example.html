        <b><ins>Berners-Lee</ins></b> considered HTML to be an application of <abbr title="Language">SGML</abbr>. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering
        Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
        Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to
        define the syntax.<sup><a href="">[9][10]</a></sup> The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic
        browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the <del>IETF's</del> philosophy of basing standards on successful
        prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "<code>HTML</code>+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993,
        suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
